    Reinhart, or Reinhard, Alspach, was born in Thaleischweiler, Germany
    in 1710.  A Calvinist and a farrier, he impregnated a woman named
    Anna Magdalena Brandstaetter outside of wedlock, much to the outrage
    of the community.  He was either forced or insisted on marrying the
    lady, which he did on November 29, 1737 and then had to leave the
    country.
 
    After travelling to Rotterdam, they booked passage for America on the
    ship Robert and Alice. They arrived in Pennsylvania on September 11th
    of the following year, along with the new baby Georg, Anna's brother
    Jacob, and Reinhart's brother Mathews, and took the oath of allegiance
    to England.
 
    They settled in Berks County, PA, and presumably the marriage was a
    happy one, or at least it resulted in several more children: Michael,
    Reinhart, Johannes (John), Mary, Heinrich, John Philip, and Johann
    Jacob.  Reinhart is buried in St Paul's Cemetery, Hamburg, Berks Co., PA.
 
    Some web sites show Anna Magdalena's maiden name as Ohlinger.
    I am not aware of any real evidence that this is the case.
 
    A will and tax assessment are available in Windsor Township.  
    The will also appears here

      The Foor genealogy site suggests that he was married in 1737 but 
      emigrated in 1736...if so, presumably there was no child with him 
      at the time!
